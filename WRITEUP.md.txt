### Comparison

| Feature      | VM                             | App Service                    |
|--------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Cost         | Higher (pay for uptime)        | Cheaper (per use)             |
| Scalability  | Manual scaling needed          | Auto-scale supported          |
| Availability | Needs setup (load balancer)    | Built-in                      |
| Workflow     | Full control, complex deploys  | Easy CI/CD, low maintenance   |

If the application needed more control over the OS or had high computational requirements (running background tasks, custom binaries, or machine learning models,...), I would choose a VM. A VM would allow installing custom libraries and offer more freedom for complex deployments.


### My Choice: App Service 
I chose App Service because it offers better scalability and is easier to maintain. It also supports easy deployment with GitHub and automatically handles scaling and availability.
